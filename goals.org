Structural Type Theory of Higher Order Languages
[[http://lics.siglog.org/][LICS]]: 29 June 2021 (due 20 Jan)

* goals
** contextualize
*** logic over a type theory
*** TODO type refinement
*** logical relations
** TODO monad on 2OAT
Grothendieck construction of model in Pos
*** hyperdoctrine and the model
*** what are its algebras?
** presentation of type system
utilize the Mitchell-Benabou language
*** semantics
**** TODO combine hyperdoctrine with model
*** features
**** subtyping & recursion
inductive rules
**** polymorphism
Fiore: Polymorphic SOATs [send]
parametric poly & generics (Java)
**** rewriting
preservation of types
***** enriched?
check V topos => Psh(V) topos
*** TODO logic
**** colaxity
**** conservative extension
**** soundness/completeness
** other important
*** TODO transfer predicates to models
*** demonstrate translations (functoriality)
*** formally define encodings
** TODO examples
*** behavior!
*** code queries
*** namespace logic
*** generators and relations
specify/query substructures
**** monoids
***** prime, ideals
**** graphs
***** query subgraphs
**** trees
*** classify algorithms (arrow type)
**** sort vs shuffle
** generalize to HOATs?
(n+1)OATs are monads on nOATs, with 1OATs = Law and 0OATs = Set
*** Ambient calculus
*** kinds in Haskell, templates in C
** implementation
*** poor man's K (diy or no?)
they treat type-checking as another form of execution
**** (gph-homo)SOAT -> parser, (compile-time) type-checker, execution engine
read in terms -> AST (with types) <expected type, term> -> check types -> then rewrites
how to turn a Gph-SOAT into a K file, with type-checking
** [write expository material]
** [modal logic, behavior types]
the parallel paper
* notes
** [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Modular_Documents][Modular Documents]]
** keep bothering Staton and Fiore
** make exposition, then condense
** connected ideas
*** structural type system
we can do structure of code, rather than just data.
*** classifying topos
